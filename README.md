WordPress MU Plugins I've come up with to make things a little cleaner
=====================
siteurl-shortcode.php

Gets current site URL with a shortcode. Add to /wp-content/mu-plugins/ (create if doesn't exist). Really useful for multisite networks. Lets you use [url] and will get that site's URL to save from copypasta or redundant uploads if you know the path.

Examples:
[url]/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/image.jpg
[url]/wp-admin/tools.php?page=domainmapping
=====================
remove-smartcrawl.php

Removes SmartCrawl Menu from the Admin bar on WordPress websites. Add to /wp-content/mu-plugins/ (create if doesn't exist)
======================
remove-youraccount.php

Remove Pro Site's "Your Account" from the WP-Admin bar. Upload to /wp-content/mu-plugins

This is only for WPMU's Pro Sites plugin. I found it redundant to have it in the Admin Bar and the admin menu (on the left). Let's keep those Admin Bars clean!
